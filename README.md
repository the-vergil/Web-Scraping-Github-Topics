## Web Scraping
Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. In most cases, this is done using software tools such as web scrapers. Once the data is scraped, you'd usually then export it in a more convenient format such as an Excel spreadsheet or JSON.

## Libraries used
1. requests ---> The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
2. BeautifulSoup ---> Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner.
3. Pandas --> Pandas has been one of the most popular and favourite data science tools used in Python programming language for data wrangling and analysis.
